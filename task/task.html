Exercise details:
1. Install Laravel

2. Create three basic API endpoints to manage Users

a. API to create user accounts.
We’ll pass the following details to the API: Username, Email, First Name, Last
Name, Password.
The API will revert with the User ID of the new user on success, else false.

b. API to edit a user account.
We’ll pass the User ID, and the field to edit. For example, we will pass a user ID
as 2, and the new value for Last Name

c. API to list all the user accounts

3. Constraint: You should not use Database to store these user details. Save them in a text
file in JSON format.

4. Create an HTML form using Blade templates which we’ll use to submit details to create
the user account.
